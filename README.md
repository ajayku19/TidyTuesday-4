## #TidyTuesday

This is my Tidy Tuesday repository. These exercises are based on the weekly datasets provided under the #TidyTuesday hashtag on Twitter.

You can either recreate the original graphic or create something of your own. There is an emphasis on using the tidyverse library but I've used other libraries as well.

This has been a great way to work on my data visualization skills. My emphasis has been on commenting my code better. Also, I've started doing tutorials in an effort to learn R markdown better.

I've also been using this as a way to learn how to use git from the command line.
